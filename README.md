# clj-ns-browser

Smalltalk-like namespace/class/var/function browser for clojure based on seesaw.

## Usage

Not yet fully baked... pls wait another week...

If you *have* to take a look now, close the repo, built with "lein deps" and "lein compile", and start your repl with "lein repl", and start the browser thru evaluating: (refresh)

(however, it may not even run on your environment yet... patience...)
