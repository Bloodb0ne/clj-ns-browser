# clj-ns-browser

Smalltalk-like namespace/class/var/function browser for clojure based on seesaw.

## Usage

Not yet fully baked... pls wait another week...

If you *have* to take a look now:
* clone the repo
* built with "lein deps"
* you have to "lein compile"
* start your repl with "lein repl"
* start the browser by evaluating in the repl: (sdoc).

Instead of cloning, you can download the tar file and work with that.

Seems to work ok on MacOSX... tested the download, install, run on a fresh account.

Works a little bit on Lubuntu - browsing works, but for some unknown reason the unloaded ns don't show up there (?))
