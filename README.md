# clj-ns-browser

Smalltalk-like namespace/class/var/function browser for clojure based on seesaw.

## Usage

Not yet fully baked... pls wait another week...

If you *have* to take a look now, clone the repo, built with "lein deps" and "lein compile", and start your repl with "lein repl", and start the browser by evaluating in the repl: (refresh).

If (refresh) brings up the browser, then probably (sdoc map) in the repl will bring up the docs for clojure.core/map in the browser.

(however, it may not even run on your environment yet... patience...)
