* "identify" function should become part of seesaw.core

			(defn identify
				"Given a root widget, find all the named widgets and set their Seesaw :id
				 so they can play nicely with select and everything."
				[root]
				(doseq [w (select root [:*])]
					(when-let [n (.getName w)]
						(seesaw.selector/id-of! w (keyword n))))
				root)

* seesaw.bind/bind function seems to work similar to threading first argument like the '->' macro

	maybe add to doc: "bind threads the first argument, much like the '->' macro"

	or maybe change name to "bind->"
